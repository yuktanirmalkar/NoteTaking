# MyNotes - A Simple Note-Taking App

This is a straightforward note-taking application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to create, save, edit, delete, search, and categorize notes.  It also features a light/dark mode toggle.

## Functionality

The app provides the following functionalities:

* **Adding Notes:** Click the "+ Add Note" button to open a modal where you can enter the note title, content, select a category (Work or Personal), and choose a background color for the note.
* **Saving Notes:**  Click "Save" in the modal to save the new note or update an existing one. Notes are stored in local storage, so they persist even after closing the browser.
* **Editing Notes:** Click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) on a note to open the modal pre-filled with the note's details, allowing you to make changes.
* **Deleting Notes:** Click the trash can icon (üóë) on a note to permanently delete it.
* **Searching Notes:** Use the search bar at the top to filter notes based on their titles.
* **Categorizing Notes:**  Use the sidebar to filter notes by category (All Notes, Work, Personal).
* **Light/Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark mode using the "Light/Dark Mode" button in the header.
